# UtilityScripts
Some scripts I've made or come across that I end up using in many projects.
In many cases, these are drag and drop friendly.  There may be some leftover junk in them like references to project-specific classes, though.
This repo is probably more for my own organization than for sharing friendliness, meaning if you have trouble with the code, try modifying it or using something else.
If you really want to use my script(s) but can't figure 'em out, feel free to shoot me a message.
I'll do my best to reply.
Happy making!
